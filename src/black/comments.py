    Comments in lib2to3 are shoved into the whitespace prefix.  This happens
    in `pgen2/driver.py:Driver.parse_tokens()`.  This was a brilliant implementation
    move because it does away with modifying the grammar to include all the
    possible places in which comments can be placed.

    The sad consequence for us though is that comments don't "belong" anywhere.
    This is why this function generates simple parentless Leaf objects for
    comments.  We simply don't know what the correct parent should be.

    No matter though, we can live without this.  We really only need to
    differentiate between inline and standalone comments.  The latter don't
    share the line with any code.

    Inline comments are emitted as regular token.COMMENT leaves.  Standalone
    are emitted with a fake STANDALONE_COMMENT token identifier.
